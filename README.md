# Undergraduate Research - Machine Learning Resiliency
I am currently investigating the resiliency of machine learning algorithms with the Hume Center for National Security and Technology at Virginia Tech.
You can learn more about the Hume Center [here](https://www.hume.vt.edu/). If you have questions about my research, [email me](mailto:rgniadek@vt.edu) and I'll answer if I'm allowed to.
